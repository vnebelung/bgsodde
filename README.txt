1 VERSION

This translation is as of 2022-02-20 and is based on SoD v2.6.6.0.

2 REMARKS

If a previous version of the mod is installed, it must be uninstalled first. Just use the install file of the installed version.

The game must not be already running during the installation.

SoD is an actively supported game, for which there might be patches from time to time. Please keep in mind that every update will clean up your game data again! After an update, the mod must be installed again.

3 INSTALLATION

If you are using SoD from GOG or Steam, you will need to prepare the game before you can install mods. There are two ways to do this:

- argent77's DLC Merger: https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases/tag/v1.3 (recommended) or
- modmerge: https://github.com/ScottBrooks/modmerge/releases

3.1 WINDOWS 32 AND 64 BIT

a) Copy the content of the ZIP file into your game directory (contains the CHITIN.KEY file), that means you should find a folder "bgsodde" and an executable file "setup-bgsodde.exe" in your game folder.
	
b) Execute the file "setup-bgsodde.exe" via double click. Confirm the installation. Now all needed files should be copied and the installation should be done. Close the installation window by pressing the ENTER key when the prompt appears.

You can uninstall the mod by re-running the "setup-bgsodde.exe" in your game folder.

3.2 MACOS 64 BIT

a) Copy the content of the ZIP file into your game directory (contains the CHITIN.KEY file), that means you should find a folder "bgsodde" and a file "setup-bgsodde" in your game folder.

b) Open the app "Terminal".

c) Make the file "setup-bgsodde" executable. Enter the following: "chmod +x " (note the space at the end!) and drag the file "setup-bgsodde" onto the terminal window. Then press the ENTER key.

d) Close the app "Terminal".

e) Execute the file "setup-bgsodde" via double click. Confirm the installation. Now all necessary files should be copied and the installation should be done. Close the installation window by pressing the ENTER key when the prompt appears.

3.3 LINUX 64 BIT

c) Make the three files "weidu", "weinstall" and "tolower" executable. Change with "cd" into your game directory and type: "chmod +x weidu weinstall tolower". Then press the ENTER key.

e) Executes the command "./weinstall bgsodde". Confirm the installation. Now all required files shoul be copied and the installation should be performed. Close the installation window by pressing the ENTER key when the prompt appears.
